# Restaurant opening process: lease signing → construction → permits → opening

This is the full process to get open once you’re ready to sign a lease. Use it as a single checklist and timeline. The app’s **Opening Plan**, **Documents & Compliance**, **Permitting Wizard**, and **Financial Projections** support each step.

---

## Overview

| Phase | Focus | Typical duration |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | Lease & pre-construction | 2–4 weeks after LOI |
| 2 | Permits (apply early) | 2–4 months (often in parallel with buildout) |
| 3 | Construction & buildout | 2–4 months |
| 4 | Final permits & inspections | 2–4 weeks before opening |
| 5 | Pre-opening & opening | 2–4 weeks |

**Total:** Roughly **4–8 months** from lease signing to opening (Boston can be longer; permit and inspection timelines vary).

## Phase 1: Lease signing and pre-construction

**Goal:** Signed lease and clear plan so you can pull permits and start buildout.

### 1.1 Before you sign

- [ ] **Lease terms:** Rent, term, renewal options, buildout allowance (TI), who pays for what (HVAC, hood, grease trap, etc.).
- [ ] **Use and zoning:** Confirm the space is zoned for restaurant use (and alcohol if applicable). Check neighborhood rules (noise, hours, outdoor).
- [ ] **Landlord requirements:** Insurance, permits, and buildout approval before construction.
- [ ] **Attorney review:** Have a lawyer review the lease (especially buildout, exclusivity, assignment).

**In the app:** *Opening Plan → Phase 3: Location & Real Estate* (lease negotiation, Boston zoning).

### 1.2 Right after signing

- [ ] **Execute lease** and get fully executed copy.
- [ ] **Pay deposits** and first month’s rent if required.
- [ ] **Notify landlord** of your opening timeline and buildout start.
- [ ] **Engage design/architect** for plans needed for permits and construction.

### 1.3 Pre-construction planning

- [ ] **Design and layout:** Kitchen, bar, dining, restrooms, storage (use Equipment Planning in the app).
- [ ] **Bidding:** Get bids from contractors; align scope with budget (Financial Projections → Startup Costs).
- [ ] **Permit strategy:** List every permit you’ll need and who applies (you vs. contractor). Many permit applications can be submitted once you have lease + plans.

**In the app:** *Opening Plan → Phase 5: Buildout* (design, equipment); *Financial Projections → Startup Costs* (construction, permits, equipment).

---

## Phase 2: Permits and licenses (start early)

Permits often run **in parallel** with construction. Apply as soon as you have what each agency needs (lease, plans, entity documents).

### 2.1 Business foundation (do first)

- [ ] **EIN** (IRS) – required for bank accounts and most permits.
- [ ] **MA business registration** (e.g. LLC with Secretary of State).
- [ ] **Boston Business Certificate** (DBA if applicable).
- [ ] **Bank account** in business name.

**In the app:** *Documents & Compliance*; *Permitting Wizard → Phase 1: Business Foundation*.

- [ ] **Plumbing permit** – plumbing work.
- [ ] **Fire / sprinkler / alarm** – as required by Boston Fire.
- [ ] **HVAC / hood and ventilation** – kitchen ventilation and exhaust (critical for health approval).

**In the app:** *Opening Plan → Phase 4: Permits → Secure Building Permits*; *Permitting Wizard* (construction-related steps).

### 2.3 Food and health

- [ ] **Food Establishment Permit (Boston)** – Boston Public Health Commission; often requires:
  - Certified Food Protection Manager (e.g. ServSafe).
  - Site plans, equipment list, menu (with consumer advisories if needed).
  - Food Plan Review Worksheet.
- [ ] **Common victualler license** (if serving food) – City/state as applicable.
- [ ] **Pre-opening health inspection** – scheduled with BPHC after buildout, before opening.

**In the app:** *Opening Plan → Phase 4 → Food Establishment Permit Application*; *Documents & Compliance*.

### 2.4 Alcohol (if applicable)

- [ ] **Boston Licensing Board** – application, floor plans, business plan, hearing, fees.
- [ ] **ABCC (state)** – state alcohol license as required.
- Timeline: often **8–12 weeks**; start early.

**In the app:** *Opening Plan → Phase 4 → Alcohol License*.

### 2.5 Other Boston permits and licenses

- [ ] **Entertainment license** (if live music, etc.).
- [ ] **Signage permit**.
- [ ] **Outdoor dining permit** (if applicable).
- [ ] **Dumpster / waste** and **grease trap** permits as required.

**In the app:** *Financial Projections → Yearly Permits & Compliance* (costs); *Documents & Compliance* (tracking).

## Phase 3: Construction and buildout

**Goal:** Space built to approved plans, all permitted work complete and signed off where required.

### 3.1 Pre-construction

- [ ] **Contractor and subs** under contract; schedule agreed with landlord.
- [ ] **Permits in hand** (or at least applied) for the work being done.

- [ ] **Inspections** as required by building permit (rough-in, etc.).
- [ ] **Hood, fire suppression, grease trap** installed and compliant.

### 3.3 Buildout complete

- [ ] **Punch list** completed.
- [ ] **Contractor sign-off** and final payments per contract.
- [ ] **As-builts / final plans** if required for permits or landlord.

**In the app:** *Opening Plan → Phase 5 → Manage Construction*; *Financial Projections → Startup Costs* (actuals vs. budget).

## Phase 4: Final permits and inspections (before opening)

**Goal:** All required permits and inspections passed so you are legal to operate.

### 4.1 Certificate of Occupancy

## Phase 5: Pre-opening and opening

**Goal:** Staff trained, systems live, soft opening done, then public opening.

### 5.1 Staffing and training

### 5.2 Operations readiness

- [ ] **POS** and payments tested; **opening inventory** (food, beverage, smallwares) ordered and received.
- [ ] **Soft opening** (friends/family or limited service) – fix issues before public opening.
- [ ] **Marketing and grand opening** plan executed.

**In the app:** *Opening Plan → Phase 6* (menu, marketing, soft opening); *Open Restaurant Manager* (ongoing compliance).

### 5.3 Opening day and beyond
