## 📚 Sources & Assumptions

- **Vendor plan limits change** (free tiers, quotas, pricing). Before publishing numbers in marketing materials, verify current limits:
  - SendGrid pricing: `https://sendgrid.com/pricing/`
  - Mailchimp pricing: `https://mailchimp.com/pricing/`
- **If we publish numeric “industry stats”** (market size, CAGR, failure rates), add the claim + source in `MARKETING_SOURCES.md` first, then reference it from the relevant section.
