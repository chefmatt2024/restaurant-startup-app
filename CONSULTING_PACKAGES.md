## Pricing and “Book a call”

- **Option A — Fixed price per package:** Set a number for each package above; list “From $X” or “$X” on the site and in proposals.
- **Option B — “Book a call to discuss”:** No public price; every CTA is “Book a call” or “Get in touch.” You scope and quote on the call. Easiest to start; you can add fixed prices later.
- **Option C — Hybrid:** Publish “From $X” for one package (e.g. Due Diligence Review) and “Book a call” for the rest.

**Where to send people:**  
Consulting CTAs go to **https://iterumfoods.com** (or your Calendly/contact form URL there). Add UTM when you link from the app or from iterumfoods.xyz:  
`https://iterumfoods.com?utm_source=iterumfoods&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=consulting`  
(or `utm_content=due_diligence`, `launch_audit`, etc., per package).
