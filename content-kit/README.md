2. **Videos:** Record from scripts; keep 30–60 seconds. Put assessment link in caption/bio and first comment. UTM: `utm_source=youtube|instagram|linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=week1`.
3. **CTAs:** Copy blocks into your CMS or static pages. Point all "Take the assessment" links to the assessment URL with `utm_content=` set per block name (e.g. `hero`, `sidebar`, `footer`).
