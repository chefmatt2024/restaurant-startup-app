## Improvements to make

### 1. About / Description

**Goal:** Align with iterumfoods.xyz and the app. Keep consulting credibility; add product and free assessment.

**Suggested About (short — for LinkedIn “About”):**

```
Iterum Foods helps restaurant owners and operators turn vision into reality—through consulting, operations, and our Restauranteur App.

Our tech division (iterumfoods.xyz) builds tools for planning, due diligence, and compliance. Try the free Restaurant Assessment: a 10-minute, one-visit checklist to evaluate a restaurant before you buy or go deeper.

Boston-based. Consulting + software for restaurants.
```

**Optional tagline (if field allows):**  
*Consulting and software for restaurant owners and operators.*

### 2. Website link + UTM

- In the company page “Website” field, use your main hub with UTM so funnel traffic is attributable:
  - **Primary:** `https://iterumfoods.xyz?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=company_page`
  - Or send directly to assessment: `https://restaurant-startup-app.web.app/assessment?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=company_page`
- Use one as the main link; use the other in post copy and “Featured” link when you add it.

### 3. Featured / CTA link

- If LinkedIn allows a featured link or CTA, set it to:
  - **Free Restaurant Assessment** → `https://restaurant-startup-app.web.app/assessment?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=company_page&utm_content=featured`
- Or **Start free trial** → `https://restaurant-startup-app.web.app?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=company_page&utm_content=featured`

### 4. Banner and imagery

- Banner: Use a clear visual that matches iterumfoods.xyz (e.g. “Restauranteur App” or “Iterum Foods — Consulting + Tech”). Include a short line like “Free Restaurant Assessment” or “Plan. Launch. Comply.”
- Logo: Consistent with website and app.

### 5. Content and posts

- **TOFU:** Tips from the Week 1 content (due diligence, permits MA). End each post with a CTA: “Take the free Restaurant Assessment” or “Explore the Restauranteur App” with the UTM link above.
- **MOFU:** Short case-style posts (“What we look for in one visit”), assessment results interpretation.
- **BOFU:** Trial and product updates, “Start your free trial” with link.
- Post 2–3x per week; use `utm_campaign=company_page` or `utm_campaign=linkedin_post` and `utm_content=post_title_or_date` in links so you can compare performance.

### 6. Funnel tracking

- Any link from the LinkedIn company page to your site or app should use:
  - `utm_source=linkedin`
  - `utm_medium=social`
  - `utm_campaign=company_page` (or `linkedin_post` for in-feed links)
  - `utm_content=` (e.g. `about`, `featured`, `post_permits`, `post_due_diligence`)
- In analytics, filter by `utm_source=linkedin` to see sessions, assessment starts, and signups from LinkedIn.
