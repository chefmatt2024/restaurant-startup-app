## H2: State-Level Requirements (Massachusetts)

- **Food Establishment Permit (MA DPH):** Required for food service; application through local board of health; inspections.
- **Allergen awareness training:** MA requires certified allergen training for staff.
- **Workers’ comp and employer obligations:** Brief note that employment-related compliance is separate but mandatory.
- Link or mention where to find the official MA application (e.g. mass.gov food safety).

---

## H2: Local / Municipal Permits and Licenses

- **Board of Health (food establishment):** Often the main local contact; plan review, inspections, fees.
- **Common local permits:** Signage, occupancy, fire, dumpster/grease, outdoor seating (if applicable).
- **Boston-specific:** Any notable Boston-only steps (e.g. ISD, fire, zoning); suggest checking city of Boston licensing pages.

---

## H2: Alcohol (If You Serve It)

- MA liquor license: types (all-alcohol, wine & malt, etc.), quota and availability by town.
- Local approval (selectmen/city) and state (ABCC) steps.
- One line: If you’re evaluating an existing restaurant that has a license, confirm it’s transferable and in good standing.

---

## H2: Typical Order and Timeline

- Suggested sequence: business entity → lease/zoning → food permit application → build-out (if applicable) → health inspection → alcohol (if applicable) → opening.
- Note that timelines vary by town and scope of work; 2–4 months (or more) is common.
