# Publishing on Medium

Use this when you publish the Week 1 (and later) blog posts on Medium. It covers setup, links, and driving traffic back to your funnel.

## UTM for Medium

Append this to every link you put in a Medium post (assessment, Restauranteur App, main site):

- **Source:** `utm_source=medium`
- **Medium:** `utm_medium=organic` (or `utm_medium=social` if you share the post on social)
- **Campaign:** `utm_campaign=week1` (change per week or campaign)
- **Content:** `utm_content=due_diligence_post` or `utm_content=permits_ma_post` (per post)

**Example full link in a Medium story:**  
`https://restaurant-startup-app.web.app/assessment?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=week1&utm_content=due_diligence_post`

## Where to put your links in the story

1. **First CTA (early in the post)**  
   In the intro, after you’ve given value: one sentence + one clear link to the Free Restaurant Assessment. Use the UTM string above.

2. **Mid-post**  
   When you mention “checklist” or “score your visit,” add a second link to the assessment (same UTM or `utm_content=mid_post` if you want to compare).

3. **End CTA block**  
   Last 1–2 paragraphs: recap + “Take the Free Restaurant Assessment” + “Explore the Restauranteur App” (trial/planning). Both links with UTM.

4. **Author bio**  
   Medium lets you add a link in your profile. Use either the assessment URL or `iterumfoods.xyz` with `utm_source=medium&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=bio`. For social, use: [Chef Matthew McPherson (Facebook)](https://www.facebook.com/ChefMatthewMcpherson), [The Restauranteur App (Facebook)](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61587938533364).

## Canonical and SEO on Medium

- **Medium and SEO:** Medium posts can rank, but Medium controls the URL and meta. For maximum SEO control long-term, you can later republish the same article on your own site (e.g. iterumfoods.xyz/blog) and set that as the canonical URL; for Week 1, publishing on Medium only is fine.
- **Subtitle (meta):** Use the 150–160 character meta description from each outline as the **subtitle** so it shows in previews when the post is shared.
- **Tags:** Add 5 relevant tags per post (e.g. Restaurant, Due Diligence, Restaurant Business, Massachusetts, Food Business) so the post surfaces in Medium search and topic pages.

## Checklist before you hit Publish

- [ ] Title and subtitle (meta) match the outline; primary keyword in title or first line.
- [ ] All links to the assessment and iterumfoods.xyz include the full UTM query string.
- [ ] At least 2 links to the Free Restaurant Assessment (intro + end).
- [ ] At least 1 link to Restauranteur App or iterumfoods.xyz.
- [ ] 5 tags added.
- [ ] Author profile link points to your site or assessment (with UTM).

## After publishing

- Share the Medium post with the same UTM so you can segment: e.g. `?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=week1&utm_content=due_diligence_post` in the Medium story URL when you share on LinkedIn/Twitter.
- In GA (or your analytics), filter by `utm_source=medium` to see how much signup and assessment traffic comes from Medium.
