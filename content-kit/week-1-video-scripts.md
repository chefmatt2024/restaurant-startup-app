## Script 1: "3 things to check before you buy a restaurant"  
**Length:** ~45 sec  
**Tone:** Direct, tip-style  
**utm_content:** 3_things_before_buy

**[0–10 sec]**  
"If you're thinking about buying a restaurant, don't sign anything until you've checked these three things in person."

**[10–22 sec]**  
"One: first impressions. Is the signage clear? Is the entrance clean? Were you greeted in a reasonable time? Two: service. Did they get the order right? Did anyone check on you? How did the bill and payment go? Three: what you can see in the dining room and restrooms. Clean tables, clean floors, stocked restrooms—no obvious red flags."

**[22–35 sec]**  
"That’s your first filter. If it fails there, dig into why before you spend on lawyers and accountants. If it passes, then you move to financials and permits."

**[35–45 sec]**  
"We built a free checklist you can use in one visit—takes about 10 minutes. Link in the caption. Score the place, then decide if it’s worth the next step."

## Script 2: "The one-visit restaurant check"  
**Length:** ~35 sec  
**Tone:** Casual, "secret shopper"  
**utm_content:** one_visit_check

**[0–8 sec]**  
"You don’t need to be a consultant to size up a restaurant in one visit. You just need a simple checklist."

**[8–20 sec]**  
"Look at first impressions—signage, entrance, how long until you’re greeted. Then service: order accuracy, pacing, check-ins, how the bill is handled. Then food and value: does it match the concept and price? And don’t skip the restroom and the floors—cleanliness and safety tell you a lot about how the place is run."

**[20–28 sec]**  
"Jot it down or use a scored checklist. Either way, use one visit as your filter before you go deep on numbers and permits."

**[28–35 sec]**  
"We have a free one-visit assessment you can do in about 10 minutes. Link in bio."

**Caption hook:** "The one-visit restaurant check (free checklist in bio)."

## Script 3: "Restaurant permits in Massachusetts—where to start"  
**Length:** ~50 sec  
**Tone:** Helpful, local  
**utm_content:** permits_ma

**[0–10 sec]**  
"Opening a restaurant in Massachusetts? Permits can feel overwhelming. Here’s where to start."

**[10–22 sec]**  
"At the state level you need a food establishment permit—usually through your local board of health. Massachusetts also requires allergen training for staff. Then your town or city: board of health again, often signage, occupancy, fire, and if you have outdoor seating or a dumpster, those can need separate approval. Boston has its own steps—check the city’s licensing pages."

**[22–35 sec]**  
"If you’re buying an existing spot, make sure the current food permit is valid and there are no pending violations. Same for the liquor license if they have one—confirm it’s transferable."

**[35–50 sec]**  
"Get your list, talk to your local health department, and keep renewals on a calendar. We’ve got a free tool to evaluate a restaurant in one visit before you dig into permits—link in the caption."

**Caption hook:** "Restaurant permits in MA: where to start (and a free assessment tool in bio)."
