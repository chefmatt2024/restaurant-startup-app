Buying or investing in a restaurant without a clear system often leads to costly surprises. You don’t need to be a consultant to run a first pass—you need a simple, one-visit framework you can use as a filter before you spend on lawyers and accountants. A full legal and financial deep dive comes later; this is the “secret shopper” layer. You can run through a scored version of this checklist in about 10 minutes with our [free Restaurant Assessment](https://restaurant-startup-app.web.app/assessment?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=week1&utm_content=due_diligence_post).

## What to Evaluate in One Visit (The First Filter)

One visit can’t replace financials and permits, but it tells you whether the place is worth a second look. Focus on: first impressions, service, food and beverage, cleanliness and safety, operations you can see, and overall vibe.

## First Impressions and Curb Appeal

Notice the basics: Is the signage clear and in good repair? Are the entrance and windows clean and inviting? Was the wait time or seating process explained? Were you greeted in a reasonable time? First impressions set the tone for how much the owner invests in operations and how seriously they take the guest experience.

## Service and Staff

Pay attention to whether staff are attentive—not on phones or disengaged. Was your order taken accurately, and were your questions answered? Did the pacing feel appropriate—not rushed and not forgotten? Did anyone check in during the meal? Was the bill and payment handled smoothly? Service is a leading indicator of training and management. If it’s broken here, it’s often broken in the back of house too.

## Food, Beverage, and Value

Evaluate food quality against the concept and price point. Were temperature and portion size appropriate? How were beverages executed—non-alcoholic and, if applicable, alcoholic? Did the perceived value for the price feel fair? Product and pricing drive repeat visits and margins; weak execution or poor value is a red flag.

## Cleanliness and Safety (What You Can See)

Check the dining room and restrooms: Are tables, seats, and condiments clean? Are floors and walkways clear and clean? Are restrooms clean and stocked? Note any visible hygiene or safety issues. Health and safety problems can kill a deal or trigger enforcement; what you see in one visit is a useful signal.

## Operations You Can Observe

From the dining room you can still infer a lot: Is the host or stand area organized? Does food running and expo look coordinated? Are there obvious “86” or chaos? Is the POS or tech in use without visible meltdowns? Disorganization in the front often points to deeper back-of-house or ownership issues.

## Red Flags That Need Deeper Due Diligence

Watch for: visible permit or license issues (expired, missing, or wrong type), major cleanliness or safety concerns, and consistently poor service or product for the concept. These don’t always mean “walk away”—they mean “verify with permits, financials, and inspections before committing.”

## After Your Visit: Next Steps

If the visit passes your filter, move on to financials, permits, lease, and legal review. If it doesn’t, you may save time and money by not pursuing further—or you negotiate from a stronger position.

# POST 2: What Permits Do You Need to Open a Restaurant in MA?

**Title (use as-is or pick from outline):**  
What Permits Do You Need to Open a Restaurant in Massachusetts?

**Subtitle (meta description for Medium):**  
Opening a restaurant in MA? Here’s a clear checklist of permits and licenses you need—state, local, and health—plus where to start.

**Tags:** Restaurant, Massachusetts, Permits, Food Business, Boston

---

Permits and licenses are non-negotiable when opening a restaurant—missing one can delay your opening or trigger fines. Here’s a straightforward list of what you need in Massachusetts (and how Boston differs where it matters). This is an overview; cities and towns vary, so always confirm with your local board of health and licensing. Before you dig into permits, you can evaluate an existing operation with our [free one-visit Restaurant Assessment](https://restaurant-startup-app.web.app/assessment?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=week1&utm_content=permits_ma_post).

## Why Permits Matter (Beyond the Law)

Getting permits right protects health and safety, limits liability, satisfies insurers and landlords, and keeps you in good standing with the health department. Doing it right from the start avoids costly delays and enforcement.

## State-Level Requirements (Massachusetts)

**Food Establishment Permit:** In Massachusetts, food service requires a food establishment permit. You typically apply through your local board of health, which coordinates with the state. Plan on inspections and possible plan review. Official details: [Massachusetts Department of Public Health — Food Safety](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/food-safety).

**Allergen awareness training:** Massachusetts requires certified allergen training for staff. Factor this into your opening timeline and ongoing training.

**Employment:** Workers’ comp and other employer obligations are separate but mandatory; make sure you’re covered before you open.

## Local / Municipal Permits and Licenses

**Board of Health:** Your local board of health is usually the main contact for the food establishment permit—plan review, inspections, and fees. Many towns also require or coordinate signage, occupancy, fire, dumpster/grease, and outdoor seating permits. In Boston, check the city’s licensing and [Inspectional Services](https://www.boston.gov/departments/inspectional-services) pages for the full sequence.

## Alcohol (If You Serve It)

If you serve alcohol, you’ll need a Massachusetts liquor license. Types include all-alcohol and wine-and-malt; availability is often limited by quota in your town. You’ll need local approval (e.g., selectmen or city council) and then state (ABCC). If you’re evaluating an existing restaurant that already has a license, confirm it’s transferable and in good standing before you rely on it in your deal.

## Typical Order and Timeline

A common sequence: form your business entity, secure lease and zoning, submit your food permit application, complete build-out if needed, pass health inspection, then pursue alcohol if applicable. Timelines vary by town and scope—two to four months (or more) is common. Start early and stay in touch with your board of health.

## Red Flags When Reviewing a Location

When you’re looking at an existing spot, watch for: an expired or missing food establishment permit, pending violations or conditional approvals, and an alcohol license that isn’t transferable or is under review. These are things to verify during due diligence; our [free Restaurant Assessment](https://restaurant-startup-app.web.app/assessment?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=week1&utm_content=permits_ma_post) helps you spot operational red flags in one visit.

## Keep Permits Organized After You Open

After opening, stay on top of renewals, allergen retraining, and inspection schedules. Use one place to track permits and compliance so nothing slips. You can [explore the Restauranteur App](https://iterumfoods.xyz/restauranteur-app?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=week1&utm_content=permits_ma_post) for business planning and permit tracking.

State, local, and alcohol requirements plus ongoing compliance form the full picture.
