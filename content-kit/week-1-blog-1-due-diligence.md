## Introduction (80–120 words)

- Hook: Buying or investing in a restaurant without a system leads to costly surprises.
- Promise: A simple, one-visit framework you can use as a first filter before spending on lawyers and accountants.

## H2: What to Evaluate in One Visit (The First Filter)

- One visit can’t replace financials and permits, but it tells you if the place is worth a second look.
- Frame: first impressions, service, food & beverage, cleanliness & safety, operations you can see, vibe.

---

## H2: First Impressions and Curb Appeal

- Signage clear and in good repair?
- Entrance and windows clean and inviting?
- Was wait time or seating process explained?
- Were you greeted in a reasonable time?
- Why it matters: sets tone for operations and owner investment.

---

## H2: Service and Staff

- Staff attentive (not on phones)?
- Order taken accurately; questions answered?
- Pacing appropriate (not rushed or ignored)?
- Check-in during the meal?
- Bill and payment smooth?
- Why it matters: service is a leading indicator of training and management.

---

## H2: Food, Beverage, and Value

- Food quality vs. concept and price?
- Temperature and portions appropriate?
- Beverage execution (non-alcoholic and/or alcohol)?
- Perceived value for price?
- Why it matters: product and pricing drive repeat visits and margins.

---

## H2: Cleanliness and Safety (What You Can See)

- Tables, seats, condiments clean?
- Floors and walkways clear and clean?
- Restrooms clean and stocked?
- Any visible hygiene or safety red flags?
- Why it matters: health and safety issues can kill a deal or trigger enforcement.

---

## H2: Operations You Can Observe

- Host/stand organized?
- Food running / expo coordinated?
- Any obvious 86’s or chaos?
- POS/tech functioning without visible meltdowns?
- Why it matters: disorganization here often points to deeper back-of-house or ownership issues.

---

## H2: Red Flags That Need Deeper Due Diligence

- Visible permit or license issues (expired, missing, wrong type).
- Major cleanliness or safety concerns.
- Consistently poor service or product for the concept.
- Note: these don’t always mean "walk away"—they mean "verify with permits, financials, and inspections before committing."

---

## H2: After Your Visit: Next Steps

- If the visit passes your filter: move to financials, permits, lease, and legal review.
- If it doesn’t: save time and money by not pursuing further (or negotiate from a stronger position).
