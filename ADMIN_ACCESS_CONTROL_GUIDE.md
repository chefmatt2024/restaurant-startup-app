## 🚀 How to Grant Admin Access

### **Method 1: Add to Authorized List**

3. Add the new email address:
   ```javascript
   const adminEmails = [
     'matt@iterumfoods.com',
     'hello@iterumfoods.xyz',
     'admin@iterumfoods.xyz',
     'newadmin@example.com'  // Add new admin here
   ];
   ```

### **Method 2: Domain-Based Access**

- This is useful for team members with company email addresses

### **Method 3: Database-Based Access (Future)**

## 🔧 Customizing Access Control

### **Adding New Admin Emails**
```javascript
// In AdminAccessControl.js

  'matt@iterumfoods.com',
  'hello@iterumfoods.xyz',
  'admin@iterumfoods.xyz',
  'your-new-admin@example.com'  // Add here
];
```

### **Changing Domain Access**
```javascript
// To allow different domain
const isIterumEmail = email && email.endsWith('@yourcompany.com');
```

### **Adding Role-Based Access**
```javascript
// Future implementation
const checkUserRole = async (email) => {
  const user = await getUserFromDatabase(email);
  return user?.role === 'admin' || user?.role === 'manager';
};
```
