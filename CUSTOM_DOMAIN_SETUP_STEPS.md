# üåê Add Custom Domain to Firebase Hosting

## Step-by-Step Guide to Connect iterumfoods.xyz

### Step 1: Access Firebase Console

2. Sign in with your Google account (matt@iterumfoods.com)

### Step 2: Select Your Landing Site
1. You should see two sites:
   - `restaurant-startup-app` (your main app)

### Step 3: Add Custom Domain
1. Click **"Add custom domain"** button
2. Enter: `iterumfoods.xyz`
3. Click **"Continue"**

### Step 4: Verify Domain Ownership
Firebase will give you two options:

#### Option A: HTML File Upload (Easiest)
1. Download the verification file
2. Upload it to your domain's root directory
3. Click **"Verify"**

#### Option B: DNS TXT Record (Alternative)
1. Copy the TXT record provided
2. Add it to your domain's DNS settings
3. Click **"Verify"**

### Step 5: Configure DNS Records
After verification, Firebase will provide DNS records to add:

#### A Records (Add these to your DNS):
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 151.101.1.195
TTL: 3600

Type: A  
Name: @
Value: 151.101.65.195
TTL: 3600
```

#### CNAME Record (Add this):
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: iterumfoods.xyz
TTL: 3600
```

### Step 6: DNS Provider Instructions

#### If using GoDaddy:

2. Delete existing A records for @
3. Add the two new A records above
4. Add the CNAME record for www

2. Delete existing A records
3. Add the new records above

#### If using Cloudflare:
1. Go to DNS tab
2. Add the A records (proxy status: Proxied)
